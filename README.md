# Offline Wallet Generator

## Purpose

A cryptocurrency "wallet" is the key or keys used to manage one or more cryptocurrency accounts containing funds.

The purpose of this library is to generate wallets for several popular cryptocurrencies "offline" (without access to the
internet, or on a machine which has never been connected to the internet).

The benefit to an "offline" wallet generator is that if you inspect the code and prepare the machine you will use to run
it, you can guarantee the absolute secrecy of the generated wallet. No one but you could possibly know the information
contained within and, depending on how you manage your wallet, it will stay that way forever.

## Philosophy

Choosing to manage your own wallet is one of the most important decisions that you could make. Although it comes with
increased responsibility, it is the only way to truly embrace the freedom that cryptocurrency offers. Any crypto veteran
will tell you the same thing: "not your keys, not your crypto". As convenient as it is to have an exchange or bank
manage your wallet for you (and take a fee for doing so), the risks of having your funds frozen or confiscated are
immense. Though it may seem daunting at first, it has never been easier to take complete autonomy over your finances.
Rise up to the challenge and embrace the financial system that you deserve.

## What to Do With Your Wallet

### Receiving Funds

The addresses in the wallets produced by this tool are yours and ready to receive funds. It is safe to share these
addresses for the purpose of receiving funds.

### Protecting Your Wallet

There are many options for how to protect your wallet:

- Secure the mnemonic (e.g. encrypt it, password protect it, hide it inside an image, etc.) and store it in the cloud
- Secure the mnemonic and store it locally (e.g. USB, external hard drive, etc.)
- Store it in a specialized "hardware wallets"
- Write it down on a piece of paper
- Memorize the mnemonic and delete the files
- Some combination of the above

Each of the above options has advantages and disadvantages in terms of security and convenience. It is ultimately up to
each individual to evaluate his needs and risks. Each individual's attack surface depends on who he is, where he lives,
what he does, and how he uses his crypto.

## Installation

There are three methods to install and use this tool:

- Docker
- Released build
- Build it yourself

Windows users should use Docker. Linux and MacOS users may use whichever method they like. Note that:
1. Building the tool from source is the safest way to use the tool
2. There's nothing stopping Windows users from building the tool from source; the process is just not documented here

### Docker

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. Ready to go!

The default Docker command for the tool is:

```shell
docker run --rm -it -v ~/:/app/output/:rw ashelkov/owg:latest
```

You can customize the output directory for generated wallets in several ways:

1. Using the volume mounting and environment variable:
```shell
docker run --rm -it -v /custom/path:/app/output -e OUTPUT_DIR=/app/output ashelkov/owg:latest
```

2. Using the command-line argument:
```shell
docker run --rm -it -v /custom/path:/app/output ashelkov/owg:latest -o /app/output
```

3. When building the image (if you're building from source):
```shell
docker build --build-arg OUTPUT_DIR=/app/output -t wallet-generator .
```

**Important**: Always use absolute paths with Docker (paths that begin with `/`). The output directory inside the container must match the path used in your volume mount. For example, if you mount `-v /host/path:/app/output`, then set `-e OUTPUT_DIR=/app/output` or use `-o /app/output`.

Note that if you specify an output directory both via environment variable and command-line argument, the command-line argument takes precedence.

## Examples

Generate a wallet file for the first 10 Dogecoin addresses using a custom mnemonic, custom password, and the default
output directory:

```shell
# Docker (note that Docker needs matching volume mount and output directory)
docker run --rm -it -v /home/user/wallets/:/app/output/:rw ashelkov/owg:latest -m -p solo -n 10 DOGE

# Release build
./owg.sh -m -p solo -n 10 DOGE

# Local build
./bin/local.sh -m -p solo -n 10 DOGE
```

Generate a wallet file for the Bitcoin addresses `m/84'/0'/2'/1'/3'` and `m/84'/0'/2'/1'/4'` using a random 12-word
mnemonic, no password, and a custom output directory:

```shell
# Docker with custom output directory
docker run --rm -it -v /home/user/wallets/:/app/custom/:rw -e OUTPUT_DIR=/app/custom ashelkov/owg:latest solo -n 2 BTC -a 2 -c 1 -i 3

# Release build
./owg.sh -e 128 -o ~/wallets/my-btc-wallet.wal solo -n 2 BTC --account=2 --change=1 --index=3

# Local build
./bin/local.sh -e 128 -o ~/wallets/my-btc-wallet.wal solo -n 2 BTC --account 2 --change 1 -i 3
```

Generate a multi-coin wallet containing the default address for every supported coin using a random 24-word mnemonic, no
password, and output the results to the console (including public and private keys):

```shell
# Docker (note that the Docker command for console output is slightly different than usual)
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint ./bin/release.sh ashelkov/owg:latest -f CONSOLE -k -K multi

# Release build
./owg.sh -f CONSOLE -k -K multi

# Local build
./bin/local.sh -f CONSOLE -k -K multi
```

## Output

### Docker

When using Docker, you can specify the output directory in several ways:

1. Mount a volume and set the OUTPUT_DIR environment variable:
```shell
docker run --rm -it -v /host/path:/app/output -e OUTPUT_DIR=/app/output ashelkov/owg:latest [options]
```

2. Use the -o/--output-file command-line argument:
```shell
docker run --rm -it -v /host/path:/app/output ashelkov/owg:latest -o /app/output [options]
```

**Important**: The path you specify with OUTPUT_DIR or -o must match the container path in your volume mount. For example, if your volume mount is `-v /host/path:/app/output`, you should use `-e OUTPUT_DIR=/app/output` or `-o /app/output`.

If both the environment variable and command-line argument are specified, the command-line argument takes precedence.

Printing to console requires a slightly different Docker command:

```shell
docker run --rm --entrypoint ./bin/release.sh ashelkov/owg:latest -f CONSOLE [options]
```

### Release and Local Builds

When saving to a file, if no custom output location is specified then the tool will write the wallet to the default
wallet directory. The name of the file will be `{coin}.{ext}`, where:
- `{coin}` is the cryptocurrency code (for single-coin wallets) or `multi` (for a multi-coin wallet)
- `{ext}` is the file extension of the output type

The default wallet directory is determined by the operating system:
- Linux: `$HOME/.wallets/`
- MacOS: `$HOME/Library/Wallets/`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\`
